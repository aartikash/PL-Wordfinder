# Different-names-same-meanings-PL

1. Fold-unfold and roll-unroll
2. type safety and type soundness: this is analogous to syntactic type safety and semantics type safety (controversial)
3. canonical form and normal forms
4. syntactic sugar and macros
5. Step-index type relation and logical relations
6. type contexts and type environments


# Similar names different meanings
1. type contexts and program contexts



# Words whose meanings can be painful
1. Logical relations: proof technique to build a relation based on types to show a notion of equivalence
2. Contextual equivalence
3. Full abstraction
4.
