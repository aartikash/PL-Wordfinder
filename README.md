# Different-names-same-meanings-PL

1. Fold-unfold and roll-unroll
2. type safety and type soundness: this is analogous to syntactic type safety and semantics type safety (controversial)
3. canonical form and normal forms
4. syntactic sugar and macros
5. type contexts and type environments


# Similar names different meanings
1. type contexts and program contexts

# Words used interchangably in the community but should not be
1. Step-index type relation and logical relations (not all LRs are sitr)



# Words whose meanings can be painful
1. Logical relations: proof technique to build a relation based on types to show a notion of equivalence
2. Contextual equivalence
3. Program Eqivalence 
4. Full abstraction


#Compiler Correctness terms
1. Homomorphic compilers -- These are compilers that have same syntax for the source and the target language. 

#General terminology
1. Computational model: A computational model is a formal theory with a (usually determinstic) notion of 
reduction that has an intedned goal to capture the operational semantics determined by the execution of an 
implementation of a functional programming language. 
2. Equational characterization:
